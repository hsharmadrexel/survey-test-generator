Survey/Test Generator Java Application
README File

Notes on the program:

Consult the comments in the code to better understand the program in more detail. The code is well commented out and is self-sufficient to understand the logic. 

All the functionalities required work in the system. When a response is modified, it is automatically saved. However, when a survey/test is modified, it needs to be saved by choosing the save survey/test option. 

Modifying the response is an add-on functionality which is still in progress. Modifying the survey and not modifying the response can result in discrepancies when the tabulation is processed.
